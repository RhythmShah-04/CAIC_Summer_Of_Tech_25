# Week 1: Baseline Analysis

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Select your target Indian metro/urban city (e.g., Bengaluru, Pune, Surat, Kolkata)  
- Gather core data on current transport: mode‚Äêshare, travel demand (VKT), and infrastructure  
- Estimate baseline CO‚ÇÇ and PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ emissions from all transport modes  
- Map accessibility gaps (areas > 15 min from major transit stops)

---

## üìå Key Tasks

1. **City Selection & Justification**  
   - Choose any large Indian city.  
   - Briefly explain why (data availability, challenges, innovation potential).

2. **Data Collection**  
   - **Population & Land Use**: total population, density, major land‚Äêuse zones.  
   - **Transport Network**: total road length, public-transit routes (bus, metro, BRT).  
   - **Vehicle Stock & Mode Share**: # of cars, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, buses; % trips by each mode.  
   - **Transit Accessibility**: locations of major transit stops/stations.

3. **Emissions Estimation**  
   - Apply standard emission factors (e.g. IPCC, TERI, ICCT) to vehicle-km estimates.  
   - Calculate annual CO‚ÇÇ and PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ by mode (tCO‚ÇÇ/yr & kg PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ/yr).  
   - Document assumptions (fuel economy, VKT per vehicle type).

4. **Accessibility Mapping**  
   - Use GIS or mapping tools to generate a 15-minute isochrone map around transit hubs.  
   - Highlight underserved neighborhoods.

  4. **Accessibility Map** (screenshot or exported map)  
  5. **Key Observations** (2‚Äì3 bullet points on gaps/opportunities)

- **Optional Attachments**:  
  - `baseline_data.xlsx` with raw data  
  - GIS project file or exported shapefiles

Good luck! Week 2 will build on this by defining future scenarios and prepping for traffic/emissions modeling.
